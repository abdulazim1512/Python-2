      "1. The subject expression \"subject_expr\" is evaluated and a resulting\n",
      "   subject value obtained. If the subject expression contains a comma,\n",
      "   a tuple is constructed using the standard rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Each pattern in a \"case_block\" is attempted to match with the\n",
      "   subject value. The specific rules for success or failure are\n",
      "   described below. The match attempt can also bind some or all of the\n",
      "   standalone names within the pattern. The precise pattern binding\n",
      "   rules vary per pattern type and are specified below.  **Name\n",
      "   bindings made during a successful pattern match outlive the\n",
      "   executed block and can be used after the match statement**.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Note:\n",
      "\n",
      "        During failed pattern matches, some subpatterns may succeed.\n",
      "        Do not rely on bindings being made for a failed match.\n",
      "        Conversely, do not rely on variables remaining unchanged after\n",
      "        a failed match.  The exact behavior is dependent on\n",
      "        implementation and may vary.  This is an intentional decision\n",
      "        made to allow different implementations to add optimizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If the pattern succeeds, the corresponding guard (if present) is\n",
      "   evaluated. In this case all name bindings are guaranteed to have\n",
      "   happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "   * If the guard evaluates as true or is missing, the \"block\" inside\n",
      "     \"case_block\" is executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Otherwise, the next \"case_block\" is attempted as described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "   * If there are no further case blocks, the match statement is\n",
      "     completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Users should generally never rely on a pattern being evaluated.\n",
      "  Depending on implementation, the interpreter may cache values or use\n",
